Passionate about coding and what requires and improve my problem solving skills. I find joy in interacting with databases and optimizing performance, with an appreciation for intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, and a keen eye for beautiful design.

#### Skills: Node.js / Flutter / React / Prisma / Laravel
