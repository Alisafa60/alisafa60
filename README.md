# Peace 👋

I'm a full-stack web developer with experience across backend and frontend technologies. My primary tech stack includes **Kotlin**, **TypeScript**, and **C#**, working with frameworks like **.NET Core**, **React**, and **KTor**. Currently exploring **Spring Boot** for backend development and **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)** for cross-platform mobile apps, and **Tauri** for desktop apps.
