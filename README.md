### Junior Web and Mobile Developer

Passionate about coding and what requires and improve my problem solving skills. I find joy in interacting with databases and optimizing performance, coupled with an appreciation for intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, and a keen eye for beautiful design.

## Skills and Experiences: 
- Backend: Node.js, Prisma, Laravel
- Frontend: üì± Flutter, ‚öõÔ∏è React
- DBMS: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB

####‚ö° Fun fact: My hands, toughened from lifting heavy weights, are anything but delicate, often unintentionally disrupting the smoothness of the colorful fabrics I adore
