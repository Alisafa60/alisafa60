### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I find joy in looking behind the scenes! Passionate about coding and what requires and improve my problem solving skills. I find joy in interacting with databases and optimizing performance â€“ tasks that not only challenge my problem-solving skills but also bring a sense of fulfillment.
My appreciation for intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, along with a keen eye for beautiful design, motivates me to strive for creating the most user-friendly interfaces possible.

Skills:  Nodejs, Flutter, Prisma, Laravel, React

- ðŸŒ± Full stack web and mobile developer
- âš¡ Fun fact: My hands, toughened from lifting heavy weights, are anything but delicate, often unintentionally disrupting the smoothness of the colorful fabrics I adore.
