### Hi there 👋, my name is Ali
Having a background in physics and nanotechnology, I'm currently immersing in the world of full-stack web development. My analytical mindset from my scientific background merges seamlessly with the challenges of coding, or at least I hope!

Skills:  JS / HTML / CSS/ Research

- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a full-stack web developer 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My hands, toughened from lifting heavy weights,  are anything but delicate, often unintentionally disrupting the smoothness of the colorful fabrics I adore.
